package confirm

// Placeholder for a potential future confirmation bubble
// For now, logic might live directly in the main session update

// TODO: Implement a confirmation component if needed, maybe using a simple
// state machine within the main model or a dedicated sub-model.
// It would likely need:
// - A message/prompt to display
// - State for which option (Yes/No) is focused
// - Key handling for selection and confirmation/cancellation
// - A way to signal the result back (e.g., a confirmationResultMsg)
