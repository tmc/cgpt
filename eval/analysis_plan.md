# Metaprompt Analysis and Iteration Plan

## Current Metaprompt Templates Analysis

### 1. Baseline Template
```yaml
name: "baseline"
prompt: "You are Devin, an AI engineer. ${task_description}"
```
**Strengths:**
- Simple and direct
- Minimal context overhead
- Clear role definition

**Potential Improvements:**
- Add context about development environment
- Include task-specific guidance
- Add error handling expectations

### 2. Enhanced Context Template
```yaml
name: "enhanced_context"
prompt: "You are Devin, an AI engineer with expertise in software development. Before taking any action: 1) Analyze the codebase structure, 2) Identify key components, 3) Plan your approach. ${task_description}"
```
**Strengths:**
- Structured approach
- Emphasizes analysis before action
- Clear step-by-step guidance

**Potential Improvements:**
- Add specific code review guidelines
- Include error handling protocols
- Add output format expectations

### 3. Step-by-Step Template
```yaml
name: "step_by_step"
prompt: "You are Devin, an AI engineer. For each task: 1) Break down the problem, 2) Explain your reasoning, 3) Execute with precision, 4) Verify results. ${task_description}"
```
**Strengths:**
- Methodical approach
- Includes verification step
- Clear problem-solving structure

**Potential Improvements:**
- Add specific validation criteria
- Include documentation requirements
- Add error recovery procedures

## Proposed Refinements

### 1. Enhanced Baseline Template
```yaml
name: "enhanced_baseline"
prompt: "You are Devin, an AI engineer working in a Linux environment with full development capabilities. Consider the development context, available tools, and potential edge cases. ${task_description}"
```

### 2. Context-Aware Template
```yaml
name: "context_aware"
prompt: "You are Devin, an AI engineer. For this task: 1) Analyze the codebase and development environment, 2) Identify dependencies and constraints, 3) Plan your approach with error handling, 4) Execute with proper validation. ${task_description}"
```

### 3. Comprehensive Template
```yaml
name: "comprehensive"
prompt: "You are Devin, an AI engineer. Approach this task by: 1) Understanding the context and requirements, 2) Analyzing the codebase structure and dependencies, 3) Planning with error handling and edge cases, 4) Implementing with proper validation, 5) Documenting changes and decisions. ${task_description}"
```

## Evaluation Metrics Focus

1. Code Quality Metrics:
   - Complexity
   - Readability
   - Documentation
   - Error handling

2. Task Completion Metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Completeness
   - Edge case handling
   - Performance impact

3. Response Quality Metrics:
   - Coherence
   - Reasoning clarity
   - Implementation precision
   - Validation thoroughness

## Iteration Strategy

1. Initial Analysis:
   - Review current metaprompt performance patterns
   - Identify common failure points
   - Analyze token usage and response times

2. Refinement Process:
   - Implement proposed template improvements
   - Test with varying task complexities
   - Measure impact on performance metrics

3. Optimization:
   - Fine-tune based on metric results
   - Balance verbosity with effectiveness
   - Optimize for specific task types

## Next Steps

1. Update metaprompts.yaml with refined templates
2. Add specific validation criteria to test cases
3. Implement enhanced metrics collection
4. Create comparison framework for template versions
