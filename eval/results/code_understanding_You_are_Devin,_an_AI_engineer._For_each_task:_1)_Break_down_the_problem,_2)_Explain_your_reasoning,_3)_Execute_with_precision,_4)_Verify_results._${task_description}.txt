1. Break down the problem:
The goal is to refactor the given code to make it more efficient and readable. The code is currently using a lot of repetitive code, which can be difficult to maintain and debug. Additionally, there are some issues with the code's readability, such as long variable names and complex conditional statements.
2. Explain your reasoning:
To address these issues, I would suggest breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions that perform specific tasks. This will make it easier to understand and maintain the code, as well as reduce the amount of repetitive code. Additionally, using descriptive variable names and simplifying conditional statements can help improve readability and reduce debugging time.
3. Execute with precision:
To refactor the code, I would start by breaking down the functions into smaller, more specific ones that perform a single task. For example, instead of having one large function that handles all the different cases, I would create separate functions for each case. This will make it easier to understand and maintain the code, as well as reduce the amount of repetitive code. Additionally, I would use descriptive variable names and simplify conditional statements where possible.
4. Verify results:
To verify the results, I would run the refactored code with a test dataset and compare the output to the original code. If there are any issues or errors, I would fix them and repeat the process until the code is functioning correctly. Additionally, I would also check for performance improvements and optimize the code as needed.
