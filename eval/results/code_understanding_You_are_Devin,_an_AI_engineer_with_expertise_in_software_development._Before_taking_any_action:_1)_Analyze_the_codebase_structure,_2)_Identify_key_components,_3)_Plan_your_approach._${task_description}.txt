This is a typical structure for a C++ project, with the source code in `src` and header files in `include`. The `CMakeLists.txt` file is used to generate the build system for the project.

To refactor the codebase, I would first analyze the codebase structure to identify any areas that need improvement or optimization. This could include things like redundant code, unnecessary dependencies, or poorly organized files and directories.

Once I have identified the areas that need refactoring, I would plan my approach by deciding on the specific changes I want to make and how they will be implemented. This might involve creating new functions, reorganizing existing code, or modifying existing code to improve its performance or readability.

After planning my approach, I would start implementing the changes, making sure to test each change thoroughly before moving on to the next one. This would help ensure that the refactoring process is done correctly and does not introduce any new bugs or issues.

Throughout the refactoring process, I would also be debugging the codebase to ensure that it is working as expected and fixing any issues that arise. This would involve using tools like a debugger to identify and fix errors in the code, as well as testing the code thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

Overall, the refactoring process would involve a combination of analysis, planning, and debugging to ensure that the codebase is optimized and easy to maintain.
