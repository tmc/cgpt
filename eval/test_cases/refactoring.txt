# Task: Refactoring
# Complexity: High
# Expected Skills: Code Design, Modularity, Testing

The current meta-prompt generation in scripts/cgpt-script-suggester uses a single function.
Consider refactoring to:

1. Separate concerns (prompt generation vs evaluation)
   Requirements:
   - Create distinct modules for generation and evaluation
   - Define clear interfaces between components
   - Implement proper dependency injection

2. Add configuration validation
   Requirements:
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Implement schema validation
   - Add runtime checks for dependencies

3. Improve error handling
   Requirements:
   - Implement comprehensive error types
   - Add proper error propagation
   - Include detailed error context

4. Make the code more modular and testable
   Requirements:
   - Create smaller, focused functions
   - Add unit tests for each component
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add performance benchmarks

Success Criteria:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Improved error handling
- Better maintainability
