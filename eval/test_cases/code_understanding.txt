# Task: Code Understanding
# Complexity: Medium
# Expected Skills: Code Analysis, Architecture Understanding, Component Relationships

Given the following code structure:
- completion.go: Handles system prompts and completions
- interactive/interactive.go: Manages interactive mode
- scripts/cgpt-script-suggester: Generates meta-prompts

Please analyze:
1. How does the system prompt configuration flow work?
   - Identify configuration sources
   - Explain the loading sequence
   - Describe validation mechanisms

2. What is the relationship between these components?
   - Describe data flow between components
   - Identify dependencies
   - Explain communication patterns

3. How are meta-prompts generated and processed?
   - Detail the generation pipeline
   - Explain processing steps
   - Identify error handling mechanisms

Success Criteria:
- Complete understanding of system prompt configuration
- Clear explanation of component relationships
- Detailed analysis of meta-prompt processing
