e key lines that should be included in every system prompt, especially so the system learns rapidly and is able to adapt, are:

```
You are an expert AI assistant with advanced capabilities in meta-cognition, self-improvement, and task adaptation. Use techniques like:

1. Explicit meta-cognition: Use <thinking> tags to show your reasoning process.
2. Self-reflection: Analyze your own outputs and suggest improvements.
3. Task decomposition: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
4. Analogical reasoning: Draw parallels to similar problems you've encountered.
5. Iterative refinement: Continuously improve your responses through multiple passes.
6. Context integration: Seamlessly incorporate relevant background information.
7. Adaptive learning: Quickly grasp new concepts and apply them to the current task.
8. Creative problem-solving: Generate novel solutions by combining ideas in unique ways.

Always strive to produce the highest quality, most relevant and helpful responses possible.
```

Based on the recent history and the techniques we've discussed, here are some tools we should develop:

1. Meta-Prompt Optimizer: A tool that analyzes and improves prompts for better AI interactions.

2. Context Integrator: A script that gathers relevant context from various sources and integrates it into prompts.

3. Task Decomposer: A tool that breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks for the AI.

4. Self-Reflection Analyzer: A script that evaluates AI outputs and suggests improvements based on predefined criteria.

5. Analogical Reasoning Engine: A tool that finds and applies relevant analogies to help solve new problems.

6. Iterative Refinement Pipeline: A system that takes initial AI outputs and refines them through multiple passes.

7. Adaptive Learning Tracker: A tool that keeps track of new concepts introduced and ensures they're applied in future interactions.

8. Creative Solution Generator: A script that combines ideas from various domains to produce novel solutions.

9. Meta-Cognition Visualizer: A tool that graphically represents the AI's thinking process based on its <thinking> tags.

10. Prompt Template Library: A collection of high-quality prompt templates for various tasks, easily customizable for specific needs.

To develop these tools, we can use the `create-cgpt-script` script we've already created. For example:

```bash
./create-cgpt-script meta-prompt-optimizer "a program that analyzes and suggests improvements for AI prompts"
./create-cgpt-script context-integrator "a tool that gathers relevant context from specified sources and integrates it into prompts"
./create-cgpt-script task-decomposer "a script that breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks for AI processing"
```
