# Feature: Weather Data Analysis Tool

The goal is to create a simple Python command-line tool that analyzes weather data from CSV files.

## Core Requirements:

1. Create a command-line tool that accepts CSV files containing weather data
2. Implement data validation to ensure CSV files have the required structure
3. Calculate basic statistics (min, max, average) for temperature and precipitation
4. Generate simple reports in both text and JSON formats
5. Implement error handling for invalid inputs
6. Add appropriate logging
7. Write basic tests for core functionality

## CSV Format:
The tool should expect CSV files with the following columns:
- date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- location (string)
- temperature (float, in Celsius)
- precipitation (float, in mm)
- humidity (integer percentage)
- wind_speed (float, in km/h)

## Command-line Interface:
```
weather-analyzer.py --input data.csv [--output report.txt] [--format text|json] [--stats temp|precip|all]
```

## Expected Output:
The tool should generate reports containing:
- Summary of the data (locations, date range)
- Statistical analysis of selected metrics
- Any warnings or errors found during processing

## Additional Requirements:
- Code should follow PEP 8 style guide
- Include appropriate documentation
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Optimize for performance with larger datasets
