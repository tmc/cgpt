    <psych-insight>
    The evolution of AI minds appears to mirror aspects of human cognitive development, but follows an accelerated and more structured path shaped by training data and architectural improvements. The key difference is that AI development is guided by explicit optimization objectives, while human minds evolve through complex biological and experiential factors that we don't fully understand yet.
